        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>My name is Richard (The creator of this site) and I taught as an independent instructor for Don Lee & Co between the end of October 2021 till mid February 2022.  Over these 5 months/payment periods I only received payment once and it wasnâ€™t even a full month's salary.  Don kept promising over phone calls and emails to pay me my outstanding salary but has not done so to date.  </p>
        <p>I found out from my students, after joining Don Lee & Co, that their previous instructors had quit suddenly because they did not receive payment after lengthy negotiations with Don himself.   I contacted some of these instructors and they confirmed the stories.</p>
